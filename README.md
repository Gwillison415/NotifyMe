[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Gwillison415/NotifyMe/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Gwillison415/NotifyMe?branch=master)

This project is [live](http://grantwillison.tech/) via the link.

If you would like to cone this repo, it can be run locally with ```npm start``` and will host @ http://localhost:3000/

The best way to view the state of the information stored on the client will be with the [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) installed in chrome.

If you're running something on that port already there will be a prompt asking you if you'd like to run it on another port.


Built With React, Redux, Bootstrap, ReactStrap ( for a little branch out on my part) and Deployed With AWS via S3.
