This project is [live](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) via the bucket.

If you would like to cone this repo, it can be run locally with ```npm start``` and will host @ http://localhost:3000/

If you're running something on that port already there will be a prompt asking you if you'd like to run it on another port.
